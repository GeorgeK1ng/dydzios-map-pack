Game name :    Lovers

Conditions: 4 player, no alliances, 1H 3C, Map Area Large, Difficulty: Normal to Hard depending on your level

Find the Titan's Gladius to win.  Rescue the lover of the cleric, Adelaide, before your neighbours or the dastardly Pink.  This is your quest. If you do not rescue the lover, Adelaide will lose the will to fight, and your game is over. Lose Adelaide and your game is over and the lover dies also.  


Info

Pink has imprisoned the lover of The Cleric Adelaide.  Entombed deep in the Underworld, the race to rescue the lover is well and truly underway, for the lover would be a tremendously powerful ally.  If you do not rescue the lover all is lost.  In a world where ships plunge nose down in the earth and the bones of old wrecks lie frozen where they were caught in the dreadful ice of the north, and in the deadly fuming swamps of the south, where the earth still shimmers and wavers in places, there is much magic and many riches.  Do not be distracted for long.....


Destroy the nefarious Pink, and your powerful neighbours if you have to.  Each searches for the lover with equal ardour. Without the lover Adelaide will immediately lose the will to win, so make sure you are first to the prison!


No hints.
