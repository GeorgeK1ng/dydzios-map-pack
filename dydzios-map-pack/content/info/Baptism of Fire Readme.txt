Players: 1 human / 6 computer
Size: Medium
Special Victory Condition: Capture the Inferno: 'Volcano'
Special Loss Condition: Loose the hero: 'Cyaph'

Background:
The land of Yresse ripped itself apart with war for hundreds of years, and even now the peace is precarious. And now a new evil has been unleashed which threatens to destroy the world.

And it is up to you, as leader of a group of rebel wizards to stop it.


Notes:
I would really like some feedback, so any comments or questions should be sent to simon_crowe@excite.com.

Although you may want to keep him safe, Cyaph should be used as your main hero.

The victory condition is to capture the inferno, but the text talks the condition being to defeat the Fire Lord who lives there. This is due to an annoyance by which if the Fire Lord has had all his troops killed excpet for fire elementals he has summoned, and he then defeats you, he will count as having been defeated (and you'd win the map even though you were defeated) because he has no troops. SO thats why I had to change the condition (just in case you wanted to know)

Tips:
There are secrets in the land of Yresse.
