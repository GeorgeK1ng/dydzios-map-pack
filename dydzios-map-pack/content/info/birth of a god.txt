Narrative:
Before the beginning of Time there was no earth, no skies, no waves, no life.

To the north was the ice-cold Niflheim, and to the south was the flaming hot Muspellsheim.

In between was Ginnungagap, the big empty gap.

Welcome to Ginnungagap, Odin !


One good advice:
Read all sign posts and texts carefully.

One more thing:
There are two (or some would say three) map objects which cannot be reached. This was done on purpose.


Cheers,

Holst
