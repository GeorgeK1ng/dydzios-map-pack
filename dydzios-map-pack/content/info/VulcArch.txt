Vulcanian Archipeligo

Teams      4

Difficulty Normal-Hard, depending on skill



To win you must find the Grail and take it to the Inferno of Grailholme.  In a land with a vast swamp girdling the Equator of the planet, you and your far flung ally must search long and hard for the Holy Grail. To find  the sacred Grail you must descend to the domain of the fiery depths, for the surface has been scoured of information and its obelisks plundered and defiled.  There are many treasures to be had, but do not be long distracted for there are others who would kill you to hasten their own search.  Find the grail or kill all other competitors to carry off the ultimate accolade.


No Spoilers (sorry, just not that kind of player :o)
