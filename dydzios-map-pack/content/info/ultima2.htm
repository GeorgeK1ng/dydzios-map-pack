<p><a NAME="Towns"></a><font size=+3>The Starting Towns</font>
<p><b>Red - Terfin</b>
<br>Everything there has always been evil, so I decided Exodus would be
here too (underground, near daddy's skull).&nbsp; I like playing them as&nbsp;
Inferno, but they can also be Necropolis.
<p><b>Blue - Castle British</b>
<br>Yes, I know it was never called that, but I needed a unique name so
the events wouldn't confuse non-Ultima junkies.&nbsp; Secondary town is
(predictably) Britain.&nbsp; Watch out for Chuckles.&nbsp; Always a Castle.
<p><b>Tan - New Magincia</b>
<br>Taken from U4-era, it's always a Necropolis.&nbsp; They're fun-loving
and evil.&nbsp; Secondary town is a made-up underground town call Ter-Ark
(thanks to Gargish Dragon for the online Gargoyle language reference -
have a link: <a href="http://Martin.Brenner.de/ultima/">http://Martin.Brenner.de/ultima/</a>).
<p><b>Green - Empath Abbey</b>
<br>Ah, the goody-goodies, always trying to make peace.&nbsp; Poor fools.&nbsp;
Secondary town is Yew, always a Rampart.
<p><b>Orange - Lycaeum</b>
<br>Taken from roughly post-u9 era, these guys have scholars and knowledge
of previous Ultima lore, so they provide lots of good clues.&nbsp; Again,
a very predictable secondary of Moonglow.&nbsp; Tower makes the most sense
to me, but I also allowed Conflux.
<p><b>Purple - Stygius</b>
<br>This is a made up town, located in the Great Stygian Abyss.&nbsp; Bastions
of neutrality and bureaucracy.&nbsp; Many town types are available because
they'd make sense for either Stygius or Skara Brae (its secondary).&nbsp;
I like Dungeon simply because they start in one, although it makes Skara
Brae look pretty silly.
<p><b>Teal - Serpent's Hold</b>
<br>Sure, they're great warriors, but I decided to make them paranoid as
well.&nbsp; Really paranoid.&nbsp; Some events here contain a nod to one
of my favorite B5 characters.&nbsp; Secondary is Jhelom, on the other side
of Destard (which Chad put here to connect them).&nbsp; I think of them
as Stronghold, but you can also choose Castle or Fortress.
<p><b>Pink - Ambrosia</b>
<br>This is the u3 version of Ambrosia, before the stranger's arrival.&nbsp;
Features a whirlpool that leads to Buc's Den.&nbsp; I like playing them
as Conflux, but many town types make sense for them or Buc's Den.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><a NAME="Dungeons"></a><font size=+3>The Dungeons</font>
<p><b>Terfin Underground</b>
<br>I guess there was one in U9, but this one really isn't based on it.&nbsp;
Contains a couple of Red's mines, the town of Exodus, and the Armor of
the Damned.
<p><b>Despise</b>
<br>Not much of a theme here, just your basic underground near Castle British,
not too huge.&nbsp; Contains the Angelic Alliance.
<p><b>Hythloth</b>
<br>Like U9, it's near New Magincia.&nbsp; Like most Ultimas, it's the
largest and takes the longest to explore.&nbsp; Contains most of Tan's
mines and the made-up town of Ter-Ark as a nod to the gargoyles near NM
in U9.&nbsp; Also contains the Cloak of the Undead King.
<p><b>Wrong</b>
<br>Located south of Empath Abbey, I went out to left field for this concept
- basically it's been rebuilt by some elves to be a garden paradise.&nbsp;
Trouble is, they don't like trespassers and they hide in the trees.&nbsp;
That means some instant combat events on the map, but you will always be
warned before stepping on one.&nbsp; Contains the Bow of the Sharpshooter.
<p><b>Deceit</b>
<br>This small dungeon is on Dagger Isle, north of the Lycaeum, and is
reputed to be the secret home of the Protectorate.&nbsp; They don't like
you, and will attack without much warning.&nbsp; That means a couple of
instant combat events on the map, but you will be warned of anything more
than a tiny token force.&nbsp; Contains the Wizard's Well.
<p><b>The Great Stygian Abyss</b>
<br>This is the starting point for Purple, and is almost as large as Hythloth
(again I think I'm being appropriate here).&nbsp; Bonus quest contains
a nod to B5.&nbsp; This is also the home of the Elixir of Life.
<p><b>Destard</b>
<br>Destard connects Serpent's Hold to Jhelom, and like U9, offers the
chance to fight dragons (not required to get to Jhelom).&nbsp; Lots of
them.&nbsp; But they guard the Power of the Dragon Father, so it's worth
it.
<p><b>Ambrosia</b>
<br>Technically not a dungeon, but it's underground (or at least underwater).&nbsp;
Like U3, it's square-ish and contains places for the four cards.&nbsp;
At least it did until the four cards were mysteriously turned into the
pieces of the Titan's Thunder.
<p><b>Covetous</b>
<br>Not too big, but like U9 it's cursed and filled with undead.&nbsp;
The good part is that it contains the Cornucopia.
<p><b>Shame</b>
<br>Also drawing on U9 for inspiration, this one is colorful and magical,
although in this game it's for elemental magic.&nbsp; In addition to walking
on elemental fields and fighting tons of elementals, you can also learn
all magic skills here.&nbsp; Don't forget to pick up the Statue of Legion
while you're here.
<p><b>Pirate Cave</b>
<br>Taken from U7, this cave is right by Buc's Den.&nbsp; That's right,
Ambrosia gets two dungeons, but that's for two reasons: The Titan's Thunder
is in my opinion the lamest of the town combo artifacts, so they get the
opportunity to get two.&nbsp; Also, they've got the whirlpool so they get
first crack at the protection of the Admiral's Hat.&nbsp; You can also
learn Navigation here.
<p><b>The Ethereal Void</b>
<br>Technically not a dungeon, but it does contain the Ring of the Magi,
and it's heavily guarded.&nbsp; Like every Ultima, the Void is mazy and
difficult to navigate.&nbsp; Yes, even with automatic pathing, it's still
a challenge to navigate (insert evil laugh).&nbsp; You may be asking yourself
why any sane person would endure this for such a lame artifact.&nbsp; The
reason is that there's a hut near Minoc that will trade you something nice
for it.&nbsp; Another free tip: there's a stable near Minoc's moongate.&nbsp;
Use it and you might be able to get done with the Void in 3-4 turns.&nbsp;
If you don't use it, and you bring slow troops, you'll be hating life.

<p><a NAME="Miscellaneous"></a><font size=+3>Miscellaneous Hints, Tips,
and Spoilers</font>
<p>Every starting town gets Town Portal.&nbsp; This is primarily because
it's a huge map, and I didn't want it to become inconveniently huge.&nbsp;
The point is, always have someone with Wisdom and Earth Magic.&nbsp; And
if you're a Stronghold or Fortress you can always learn it from someone
else...
<p>No one gets View Air, View Earth, Fly, or Dimension Door without the
tomes.&nbsp; Guess where those are...
<p>Stonegate is a good place to own.&nbsp; Get there before the Shadowlords
and receive a nice bonus.
<p>Dawn is a good place to own.&nbsp; Although it doesn't disappear and
reappear like in U3, it does give a periodic bonus.
<p>The Forge of Virtue is nice too.&nbsp; Guess which blade you get...
<p>Navigation is useful.
<p>There's a surprise combat at the entrance to Deceit, but it's not tough.&nbsp;
Just don't go there with only one unit.
<p>Part of the Stygius bonus quest requires you to die, but you can retreat.&nbsp;
Point is, don't send valuable troops, and split the armies into a few stacks
in case the enemy gets a morale bonus.
<p>Scouting and spyglasses are nice to have in the Void.&nbsp; So is Logistics.
<p>There are many, many pirates at Buc's Den.&nbsp; If New Magincia can
get the Cloak before Ambrosia takes the cave, they can get many, many Liches.
<p>If you want more spoilers, just open it in the editor - I'm done here.
