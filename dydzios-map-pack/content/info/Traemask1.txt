Victory Condition - Defeat Monster Stack	

Loss Condition - Die.  (While there is no technical loss condition, losing Sedran, Roland or Andrea should be considered a loss condition for story purposes.  Additionally, I had toyed with the idea of making losing Progress a loss condition, but my testers advised this might be too difficult.  Players wishing extra challenge may want to self-impose this as a loss condition -- personally I found it very rewarding.)

Special Thanks to Keith Williams (keith.williams@virgin.net), Rachel Butt (Dragonsister - rbutt@pcug.org.au) and Holst (The Player) for playtesting this map.  Additional special thanks to Timothy Pulver (FNORD - fnord@telus.net) for helping me out with a lot of the tougher ideas.

IMPORANT INFORAMATION YOU _MUST_ READ BEFORE PLAYING THE MAP!		  
As usual, there are several notes that I should add here.  I will number them for your viewing convenience.  PLEASE READ THEM BEFORE PLAYING. You will avoid some headaches.

ALSO, for players who are STUCK - there is a list of all quests and solutions at the very bottom of this file.  A friendly piece of advice: waging a defensive war around the Outpost of Progress will only get you killed.

1. Make no mistakes: this is a STORY-BASED map.  I take no responsibility for your disappointment when you play this map and don't like the fact that there is a lot of text.  I'm warning you ahead of time: if you don't want to read a lot of text and become engaged in a story, do not play.  I got several emails for my last map, Sander's Folly, telling me that they didn't like how much text I put in the map.  That's like writing Stephen King and telling him you don't like to read his books because they're violent.  :)

2. This map is somewhat unique in the way it is played.  Although it is singleplayer, there are three human-only positions.  Therefore, you _MUST_ play this map in hotseat mode.  This means you have to start a new MULTIPLAYER game.  You won't find the map listed in the singleplayer directory.  You must make names for THREE human players (not 2 and not more than 3 but 3 exactly).  Also, I should add, this is a SINGLE player map only... do not try to play this with more than one human being.  It was not built for such play and will not work out well, as some factions may have long periods of inactivity.

3. There are some discrepancies that I know of but which cannot be helped.  These are: 

a.) Some gray towns that are supposedly neutral will have some troops in them when you get there.  Even though an event tells you that the town "welcomes you with open arms", nothing can be done to eliminate the garrison that "protects" the town.  This contrasts with story elements, but that's life, I suppose: there's always someone who wants to kill you :)

b.) This map is fairly complex as far as quests and character development goes.  As it is a heroes map, I want to allow you the freedom to do what you wish; however, I recommend you try to follow the instructions (and the story) in the map as well as you can.  If a certain hero is told to do something, try to do it with that hero.  This will make the story flow more logically and may also save you from doing things out of order and getting confused.  Example: if you take Murak Mol to conquer Togor, that is fine, but you will get events on the way that are geared towards Sedran and his entourage.

c.) Beware the defeat hero bug! There are two quests where you are requested to defeat a certain hero.  After you kill said hero, if you save and quit before going back to the quest hut to obtain your prize, the computer will not recognize your kill when you load the game again.  Therefore, after you kill said hero, OBTAIN YOUR REWARD _BEFORE_ QUITTING THE GAME.

d.) It appears that sometimes when you load a saved game, events which you have already visited will re-trigger when you go over them again.  This appears to be related to the hot-seat mode, though it doesn't happen all the time.

4. It may be helpful to label the player positions as Jarrid Saed (Red), Sedran Patre (Blue) and Mead/Swift (Green) when you load your new game.

5. There is nothing I can do to prevent you from sending money from one faction to the next.  I encourage you to resist doing this, as it really does not make sense in the story, at least until such point as the player positions "are communicating".  You will recognize this point in the story when it comes.  However, players finding this map to be too difficult (it IS hard) may find that cheating in this fashion might help you out a bit.

6. Mentioned earlier, but: players who want to maximize the difficulty of this map should play as if losing Progress is a loss condition.  I may make an impossible version of this map in the future, but for the time being, this is certainly a way to make it more difficult.

**7. May 8th 2001.  A few things have been updated which will have a minor effect on the game.  However, I wanted to add here that some people have had an error message that says, "Runtime Error" when trying to load the map.  This seems to be related to starting heroes having no starting spells.  If you encounter this problem when trying to load the map, I have a fix that I can send to you.  Just email me.

**8. June 10, 2001.  The solution to the problem in #7 above is rather bizarre.  Giving a starting spell (disguise) to the four major human players (Sedran, Saed, Roland and Andrea) seems to make this runtime problem disappear.  I have no idea why!  In any case, this version of the map has this fix applied.  If it STILL doesn't work, let me know and I'll try to come up with another solution.

**9. Jan 26, 2005.  A long time since I updated.  Not too many fixes here; mainly grammatical fixes and a few little bugs.  Also increased the amount of time you have until you have until ANdrea has to visit the shrine to the west.

A list of Quests and Their Solutions.
Formula: Where; What to get; Where to get it; Reward.

Note: many quest huts give information which is more valuable than the actual "reward".  For example, a hut that gives 2,000 exp as a reward may also provide information telling the player where to go next.  Therefore, huts that simply give gold or experience are not necessarily "non-essential".
