********************* *  * OVERVIEW *  * ********************

	In contrast to most Lord of the Rings based scenarios,
 Middle Earth depicts the conflicting factions and massive 
 battles of the Third Age as opposed to a single
 adventure. As a map, Middle Earth presents you with a vast
 array of strategic choices. You must take your place as the
 head of an emerging Third Age faction and lead them to
 greatness through an age of barbaric medieval warfare across
 well detailed battlefields, from the shifting sands of Harad
 to the dismal wastes north of Arnor. The most obvious path to
 victory lies in finding the Ring of Power (that is, vitality)
 and delivering the priceless artifact to Mount Doom, either 
 to destory it or to reclaim it. In addition, certain factions
 (the Elves, for instance) have access to Valinor, the Land of
 the Gods, and in desperation they may call upon the army of
 the Valar for aid against the forces of darkness, though the
 way there is long and dangerous. This is no place for the
 faint-hearted, this is MIDDLE EARTH.

Note:The factions do not start with equal forces. However, most of
 them have a balance of initial forces and  enemies. Sauron, for]
 instance, begins with four cities (three, actually, for Mount
 Doom can not be built at) and four heroes, but he has five enemy
 factions to battle.The dwarves and hobbits begin with two cities
 and meager forces, but are in isolated corners and not likely to
 be attacked for a while. Saruman has only one city and one hero,
 as well as plenty of enemies, but receives reinforcements
 regularly and has a good number of minions.




********** *  * CHANGES FROM ORIGINAL MIDDLE EARTH *  * **********

	This is the new and improved version of the original
 Middle Earth map, and quite frankly is thirteen times better.
 Here are some of the additions/corrections included:
	1. New Loctaions, including Numenor, the Glittering Caves,
		 and the Blue Mountain Mines
	2. A detailed undergroud layer, with more resources,
		 monsters, and a few surprises
	3. All artifacts and resources are now pre-defined,
		 to reduce the chances of the AI getting tbe Ring
 		 of "Vitality" as a random artifact in the
		 beginning of the game.
	4. More diverse landscapes, with new patches of terrain
		 and better forests and mountains
	5. New rumors and timed events to add to the Middle Earth
		 experience
	6. Nations' forces adjusted: 
		Dwarven free resources and creatures reduced.
		Saruman now gets reinforcements periodically, to
			 compensate for having only one town.
		Sauron gets tribute and some reinforcements, but
			 starts with less forces in Harad.
	7. More resources lying around (Lack of these used to be
			 a problem.)
	8. Existing locations adjusted:
		Dol Guldur is now accessible other than from Mordor.
		Less Dwarf Hovels in the Shire (There used to be
			 too many of them.)
		Harad more detailed
		More objects and terrain in Valinor
		Moria and all other caves redone, with much more
			 detail.
		The orc town Khazad Dum is now Moria, and Khazad
			 Dum is a seperate town. (unclaimed)
	9. And much, much more!
