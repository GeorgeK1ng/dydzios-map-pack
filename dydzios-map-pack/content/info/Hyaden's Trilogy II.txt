notes :



Hyaden's Trilogy :
I   : Under the Guardian Wings
II  : The Dead Claw
III : Colours of the Rain





- This is the second chapter of Hyaden's Trilogy, the campaign map of three maps.
- Although Hyaden is using Kyrre's portrait which is default was female character, he is a male character.

- The map can easily win by special win if you go to the right directions, but you may want some challenge by defeating all Fortresses in Dead Claw.
