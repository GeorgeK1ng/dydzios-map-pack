Welcome to my map, and thank you for playing!  Game play (as well as enjoyment) will GREATLY vary depending on who you play.  If you are an experienced player, please try out Blue ... you'll have a great time!  Inexperienced players will be most comfortable with Rose and Red, and intermediate players will enjoy Teal and Orange the most.  These are my intentions, but of couse you know that with a little luck and just the right artifact in the shipwreck survivor, anything goes!  Please read the story as it will provide clues, don't forget to check the rumors for hints at the tavern, and read read read all of the signs if you can't find those seer's artifacts.  Feel free to mail me with your comments, corrections, and constructive criticism ... I'm working full time so don't expect a hasty reply!  Have fun .....
