Thanks for downloading my map!

This is essentially a single-player map. Because of the closeness of the two human players, the map is unsuited for competitive multiplayer, and I have therefore included a highly modified allied version for multiplayer games. It has a greatly reduced story, and Purple has been removed entirely, along with the special victory and loss conditions.

Due to an annoying bug, when you defeat Dace in the single-player map and gain the Orb of Vulnerability, the game does not always recognise that you have acheived the victory conditons. Hitting the End Turn button usually solves this problem.

If you have any feedback, questions, or problems to report, please contact me (anima@start.com.au).

Good luck, and have fun.
