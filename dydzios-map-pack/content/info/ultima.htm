<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>I'll be honest - I like overkill.&nbsp; Huge, obscenely powerful armies
obliterating each other, zillions of creatures, high level heroes, powerful
artifacts, all that good stuff.&nbsp; And I like Ultima.&nbsp; The whole
series, ever since playing the very first Ultima on an ancient Apple ][.&nbsp;
Even Pagan.&nbsp; Yes, there, I've said it.&nbsp; I liked Pagan.&nbsp;
So there.&nbsp; But anyway, I thought it'd be cool to bring Britannia to
Heroes, so here it is.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+2>Requirements:</font>
<br>Heroes of Might and Magic III
<br>Heroes of Might and Magic III: Armageddon's Blade
<br>Heroes of Might and Magic III: Shadow of Death
<br>-or-
<br>Heroes of Might and Magic III Complete
<p><a href="ultima.zip">Download the map here (150k)</a>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+2>Installation Instructions:</font>
<br>Unzip the map file into the "maps" directory in your Heroes III directory.&nbsp;
Run Heroes III.&nbsp; Pick the "Ultima" map.&nbsp; Play.&nbsp; Enjoy.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+2>Map details:</font>
<br>- XL Map, 2 levels
<br>- 8 Players, all available to play as human
<br>- 8 unique viewpoints on the events of the world
<br>- A Horde of events that should amuse hardcore Ultima fans
<br>- Lots of custom heroes from the various Ultimas
<br>- All the combo artifacts (I know it sounds munchkin-like, but you
really won't get more than one or two each time you play unless you go
far out of your way)
<br>- Bonus quests that are sometimes difficult, but won't take your heroes
away from the action for too long
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+2>For the Parents:</font>
<br>Although it contains some twisted humor and makes evil sound like fun,
it's basically pretty clean.&nbsp; We'll rate it about a PG-13.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+2>The Players:</font>
<br>- Each player has a different personality and perspective on the events
that occur during the game.
<br>- Most players are (plotwise) generally evil, since otherwise they
wouldn't fight each other.
<br>- Some players have an easier time than others, just due to their location
on the map.&nbsp; Don't expect balance.
<br>- Everyone has a primary town, with a secondary town that's not too
hard to find, always the same town type as the primary.
<p>Here are the different sides:
<p>Red - Terfin, home of Great Evil
<br>Blue - The Castle of Our Liege Lord British
<br>Tan - The Ruins of Prideful Magincia, now home only to corpses
<br>Green - Empath Abbey, bastion of love
<br>Orange - The Lycaeum, home of the greatest scholars in the land
<br>Purple - The Great Stygian Abyss
<br>Teal - The Militant Keep of Serpent's Hold
<br>Pink - Secret, Underground Ambrosia
<p><a href="ultima2.htm#Towns">Comments on Locations (minor spoilers)</a>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+2>The Dungeons:</font>
<br>Every major Ultima dungeon is in the game, and I've tried to make each
dungeon special in some way (usually consistent with at least one Ultima)
so they don't get too boring, so there's almost always a theme.&nbsp; Also,
each of the dungeons contains a combination artifact broken into pieces
and guarded by strong monsters.&nbsp; Every starting town is near a dungeon,
and some island starting locations were so cramped that they have some
of their mines underground.

<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+2>The Music:</font>
<br>If you're fortunate enough to have MP3's derived from Ultima 9:Ascension,
they make really cool background music for this map.&nbsp; Although the
only publicly available MP3's were Stones (chamber) and Good vs Evil, there
was (and might still be) a CD available from Origin with all the music.&nbsp;
Here are my suggested mappings:

<p><font size=+2>Other Stuff:</font>
<br>Custom Heroes start with slightly improved stats (except Katrina -
she's "special").&nbsp; Use them.&nbsp; Also, we actually bothered to give
all the custom heroes a short bio, so check those out (click their picture
in the Hero Window).&nbsp; Here's a free sample featuring an enemy from
Ultima 7:
<br>"Poor misunderstood Horance.&nbsp; All he wanted to do was extend his
lifespan so he could continue his research into Sprituality, but something
went tragically wrong and the towne of Skara Brae got a massive flaming
enema.&nbsp; Now he lives underground, neither living nor dead, and the
greatest tragedy of all is that he has no servants."
<p>There are a lots of tavern rumors, but for some reason HOMM3 picks its
own lame rumors more often than I'd like.&nbsp; Still, they're worth checking,
as mine sometimes have valuable clues.
<p>There are a few B5 references here.&nbsp; No, make that a few <i>shameless</i>
B5 references here.&nbsp; I figure they made the entirety of Serpent's
Hold into a ST:TNG reference in U7, so I get to have a sci-fi indulgence
too.&nbsp; Fans should recognize them instantly, but I think they stand
well on their own.
<br><a href="ultima2.htm#Miscellaneous">Miscellaneous Spoilers</a>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+2>Disclaimers for the Ultima junkie:</font>
<p><b>Disclaimer One:</b>
<br>I took great liberties with the Ultima saga.&nbsp; Many things are
different, or in the wrong place, or completely made up, just because I
thought it'd play better.&nbsp; Any complaints (How come my favorite NPC
isn't there?) will be read out loud using the voice of the comic-book guy
on the Simpsons.
<p><b>Disclaimer Two:</b>
<br>The premise of the plot is cheesy.&nbsp; This isn't really a spoiler,
since it happens to everyone on day one:&nbsp; Some sort of time disturbance
has happened so that I could justify putting elements from most of the
Ultima series on the same map.&nbsp; The rest of the plot is less cheesy,
or at least somewhat amusing.
