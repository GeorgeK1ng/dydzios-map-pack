Designer Notes:

This map is intended primarily for multi-play.  There are some AI boosting 
events that allow for semi-challenging single play, but even so please play on 
at least Hard and preferably Expert level.  The poor AI can't figure out how to 
fulfill the special win condition, so it is somewhat limited in that respect.
 
The strategic premise of this map is to try to wean the players away from the 
old massive-buildup-for-two-months-with-a-single-titanic-battle-at-the-end 
tactic that seems so prevalent in most multi-player maps.  If both players 
insist on doing that, then there is nothing to stop it.  But this map rewards 
aggressiveness and exploration, so a player who plays defensively will usually 
get an unpleasant surprise if the other player gets free reign over the common 
areas.  As a result, quite a few Scout and smaller army skirmishes should result 
during gameplay, which should spice things up a bit.

The grail is located in a random hex in the evil fog.  Digging for it so close 
to a 1-way gate exit should be nerve-wracking and should provide an early point 
of conflict. (And maybe loss of the grail!)

To get to the second 1-way gate (where the two are in a row), simply "plug" up 
the exit point of the first with a hero, then you will be able to proceed to the 
next one.

The Sphere of Permanence is actually available at the head of the 4 locations of 
the 4 elements (Earth, Fire, Water, Air).  The only way to get there is to have 
the scroll of water walking (two available), and the only way to get that is by 
getting the Statesman's medal on the surface from in front of the temples in 
either the Valley of Earth or the Valley of Shifting Sands.
