notes :



Hyaden's Trilogy :
I   : Under the Guardian Wings
II  : The Dead Claw
III : Colours of the Rain





- This is the third chapter of Hyaden's Trilogy, the campaign of three maps.
- Although Hyaden is using Kyrre's portrait which is default was female character, he is a male character.

- Try to capture those border outpost very soon and watch out for enemy's move.
- The six months time limit use only to avoid player for being time consuming. The map can be win in least then four months.
