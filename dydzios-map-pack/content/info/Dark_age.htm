Update info:	First Map Version, 3rd Read Me version</pre>

<pre>Description:	You have to capture the Inferno town of Demon Gate,
		without losing the hero Garth. The storyline is introduced by
		different events and continues until you are either victorious
		or dead. The style of the map is 'like a path'.
		Playtime is rather long (approx. 90 turns). The options to 
		freely move about have been limited so that the computer will put 
		up a more effective resistance. Map Difficulty has been estimated 
		to Hard (in conjunction with setting the Player Difficulty to 
		Expert). First timers may claim that the map is too hard, but
		after a few tries, you'll find it easier. I would recommend that
		you do not choose any Player Difficulty other than Expert
		(- Make sure to choose the Resource Bonus, though).</pre>

<pre>Special Win:	Capture Demon Gate
Special Loss:	Lose the hero named Garth
Special Other:	none</pre>

<pre>Narrative:	You are Garth, the son of the Captain of the isolated town of 
		Iceguard. You have been sent to investigate the disappearance
		of your neighbour to the southeast, Ellard the wheeler. Soon you
 		realize that something strange is going on...</pre>

		criticism (both positive and negative) was of great help in the
		maturing- and improving process of the map. The linguistic
		advice was splendid!

SPOILERS:	WARNING!!!  SPOILER INFORMATION FOLLOWS PROCEED AT YOUR OWN RISK!
</font></pre>

<pre><a name="The Basic Hints are:"><font color="#008080">The Basic Hints are:</font></a>
</pre>

<pre><font color="#008080">* Magic skills are important, choose them wisely.
  Don't count on getting 'Town Gate', 'Summon Boat', 'Dim Door',
  'Fly', or 'Waterwalk'.
  (-Wisdom is not so important)</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#008080">* Archery would be extra beneficial to Garth. If you never get to choose
  it, you'll have to cope anyway (- consider it bad luck or poor choosing).</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#008080">* All Inferno Cities have the same name, making it a bit more
  difficult to find the one you need to conquer.</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#008080">* Your aim should be to have built the Training Grounds before the end 
  of the first week. This means securing the sawmill by day 1 or day 2.
  A citadel should also be in place by that time.</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#008080">* Hire a second Hero (preferably Knight/Cleric) and add his/her troops
  to Garth's, before he leaves from his starting position.</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#008080">* Have you noticed the Lean-To, closeby, south of Iceguard?</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#008080">* After clearing the watermill area and securing the wood supply (the order
  of these can be reversed at your preference), you should try to get hold
  of the ore to the west.</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#008080">* If you are still low on wood before the 2nd week starts (meaning no chance 
  of getting the Cavaliers structure), then maybe you should consider a restart.
  </font></pre>

<pre><font color="#008080">* Remember - You have a marketplace in South Gate. Trading for wood may not be
  uncommon, especially during the 2nd week.</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#008080">* The garrison to the north looks more dangerous than it really is, but don't
  turn your attention to it until the rest of the areas south of it have been
  cleared.</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#008080">* Blue, Tan and Green have unreachable resources which will aid them and be of no
  use to you. (You will probably not even see those resources). That is why they
  can afford their armies and conquering their lands and towns won't yield very
  much gold nor resources. This is because you don't want huge amounts of gold
  and resources piling up in your treasury all the time, do you?</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#008080">* At the closing stages you might need to be sneaky. You might consider your
  troops to be tremendous and your skills to be great but nevertheless...
  Don't use up all your movement points and disguise yourself to improve 
  your chances of not being attacked by a strong hero such as Lord Skel.</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#0000A0">If you didn't do well at your first try - don't despair and feel frustrated.
Only the very best and most lucky beats the map at the first try. Well, if you
think the map is too hard, then you are wrong! Read the Advanced Hints!</font></pre>

<pre><a name="The Advanced Hints are"><font color="#800040">The Advanced Hints are</font></a><font
color="#800040">:</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#800040">* Speed is the most essential quality of a good hero. Remember the beginning:
  &quot;...soon it may be unstoppable!&quot;</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#800040">* Always pick gold over exp (until you have passed those Behemots in the N).</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#800040">* Air and Earth Magic could be Essential, meaning if you get to choose them,
  you should probably do that right away.

* You can reach the sawmill on day 1. On day 7, you should end your movement in
  Iceguard (carrying only cavalry), thereby being able to reach to South Gate on
  the first day, week 2.</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#800040">* Trade for wood to be able to build a castle a few days before the end of week 2.</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#800040">* Never mind about an Archer's Tower at first - build a Monastery instead.</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#800040">* Don't hire too many troops. When going for South Gate, 5 Cavaliers are enough,
  coupled with what you already have. After So.Ga. - keep the 5 Cav and bring
  along lots/a horde of Halberdiers for the risky battles.</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#800040">* Saving the money will allow you to have a Capitol by week 2 Day 5 or 6.
  (Day 7 is the day for building the Monastery)</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#800040">* If you are lucky with finding wood then you'll have Champions at the
  beginning of week 3. At that time, hire all Zealots and Cavaliers/Champions,
  and bring along appr. 70 Halberdiers (in 2 groups at first). Take out the
  garrison and head N. You may wish to bring along some Marksmen for 
  sacrificing purposes.</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#800040">* Take the gem mine and defeat the Black Knights.</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#800040">* Descend... by day 7 (week 3) you should be close to the surface, or on the
  surface again. Head to town to gain the stables bonus. Day 2 is the day when
  the reinforcements arrive. This marks the departure time for the Black Border.
  You should now have a large force. (31 Crusaders, 13 Champions, et.c.)</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#800040">* Take out the Iron Golems but let somebody else pick resources. Take out the
  Behemots and the Vampire Lords. You can examine the Tomb or have someone
  else do it.</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#800040">* Head for Illuria. Take out Blue's Castles then rest a week while visiting the
  Arena and awaiting reinforcements. Month 2 Week 2 Day 1 is a nice day for 
  beginning the journey beyond the Black Border again. A week later is acceptable,
  but then you'll have to hurry up a bit.</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#800040">* Only visit the Dragons if you feel sure they'll join you - slim chance!</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#800040">* Down in the dungeon again, you will have a force of mighty troops:
  &gt;150 Halberdiers, &gt; 60 Marksmen, ,&gt;40 Royal Griffins, &gt;50 Crusaders,
  &gt;30 Zealots, &gt;17 Champions and 2-5 Angels.</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#800040">* This force can easily take out all opposition down here, if you use your spell
  skills right.</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#800040">* Entering the swamps with this force will guarantee a victory. However it can be
  a tough time anyway. Remember that new fresh troops await you in the Ancient
  city of Arcana. So after having dealt Tan his death blow, head there.</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#800040">* Before you leave, leave 1 slot for the Black Dragon.</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#800040">* In Arcana, buy all troops from Archmage and up, then upgrade them and visit
  the Seer.</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#800040">* Now try to persuade the mages to join you - it's not a disaster if they don't.</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#800040">* Visit the white tent and make sure you know how to Disguise yourself.</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#800040">* Try taking Ivor out. You need to use Earth Magic at expert level to avoid too
  big losses. The Golden Bow is your prize. If you suffer big losses you have to
  hire a hero in Cathras (city in the swamp) and employ mighty swamp armies.</font></pre>

<pre><font color="#800040">* Finally head to Anglia, upgrade any Angels and destroy Demon Gate without
  getting killed by a strong Hero, e.g. Lord Skel or Axtrodus.

<a name="My comments on the map"><strong><u>My comments on the map</u></strong></a><strong>:

</strong><font color="#000000">I have tried to make a map that is (a little) different from a standard map.
</font> <font color="#000000">This map is intended to also be enjoyable at the 2nd and 3rd+ tries
(- at those times you will be familiar with most of the terrain).</font>
<font color="#000000">Of course the taste of people varies, but mr Bernie Margolis who was my
outside tester, found the map a lot enjoyable and so do I.</font>
<font color="#000000">
Along with the map there is a storyline. The storyline is intended to add
a sense of atmosphere to the map.</font>
<font color="#000000">I have tried to write the events using a nice layout.</font>
<font color="#000000">
There is a reason as to the many hints on the Dark Age text file;</font>
<font color="#000000">They are supposed to make it easier for players (who aren't familiar with
this genre of maps) to complete the map and hence the story.</font> <font
color="#000000">I consider the
story to be the main reason of playing this map.</font>
<font color="#000000">One of the aspects of the map is to use your available troops in an effective way.
This includes knowledge of troop evaluation (-&gt; a good building strategy).
E.g: A Cavalier (100 hits) is far more useful than, say, 10 Marksmen (100 hits).</font>&nbsp;
<font color="#000000">The same is true of the 2ndary skills of Garth's.</font>
<font color="#000000">
Also, consider his not having the Archery skill as a hidden potential, of which
he isn't aware at the start of his journey.</font>

<font color="#000000">Half of the joy (intended with this map) lies in the replaying of the map
and finally in the winning of it and in the completing of the story.</font>
<font color="#000000">If this is achieved at your first try, then you are to be congratulated,
because I don't consider it likely.</font>
<font color="#000000">[The fact is that even Avali (- the ancient heroine) did not succeed in
the mission Garth is undertaking.]</font>

<font color="#400080">Why are there no invaders?</font><font
color="#FF0080">&nbsp;</font>
<font color="#000000">Following the storyline, Iceguard is not going to be attacked by invaders this time.</font>
<font color="#000000">(- However, a possible sequel [concerning Dragon Dunes et.c.] might well include
such elements)</font>

<font color="#400080">Why is the rating set to Hard?</font>
<font color="#000000">These are the aspects I consider when deciding the difficulty of a map:</font>
<font color="#000000"><em>Hard</em>: If the player plays at optimal capability, then there is a small chance of
losing the map anyway.</font>
<font color="#000000">(In this map: Getting caught by Pu/Or's strongest hero -&gt; loss.
Chance of this happening: Small [- estimated through playing the map many times])</font>
<font color="#000000"><em>Expert</em>: Following the same pattern as <em>Hard</em>, but chances of losing are Medium.</font>
<font color="#000000"><em>Impossible</em>: As <em>Expert</em>, but chances of losing are High.</font>

<font color="#000000">My best results: Usually I win the map in around 83 days. However, I have won
it in 76 days (- which is not so good, because then one misses out on the last
timed event on day 80).</font>
Don't try to last 5 months or so - you will fail.
<font color="#000000">The date of finishing should not be taken as very important in comparison to
finishing the story.</font>

<font color="#000000">I have left parts of the story to the imagination of the players.
A first sequel would include a termination of the quest to find Darill, though.</font>
<font color="#000000">Well, that covers my comments about the map.</font>
<font color="#000000">If you haven't played it, my personal opinion is that it is worth playing.</font>

Greetings,
Jörgen Linde.</pre>
