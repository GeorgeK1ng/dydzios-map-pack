Designer Notes:

Welcome to your Vietnam!  This map is intended to show how truely formidable the 
Fortress is on its' own territory.  At first, it seems the sides are not balanced, 
since Red/Blue start out stronger and get continually reinforced throughout the game.
But Orange/Pink have the home turf advantage, and will get stronger as the game 
progresses.  This is very difficult to balance, which is why I recommend 4 humans play
rather than the AI.  If one team is the AI, then the humans should be the Fortress 
team, since the AI handles the multiple gates there usually horribly and would not 
provide too much of a challenge.

Even though it would have added to the story line, I kept the invading starting towns
and heroes random, since people seem to enjoy picking their own rather than being 
locked in.

The green tent is the key for the invaders.  They must unlock it order to invade
the Guild headquarters.

All Crystal and gem mines are in the swamp.  Castles that depend on them are not too 
disadantaged, since there is resources laying around, and some structures are built
for them, as well as a market close by.
