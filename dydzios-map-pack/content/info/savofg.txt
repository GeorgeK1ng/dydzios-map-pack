-This map should have no other creatures than ones of Greek myths and humans. The list is Pikeman, Archer, Griffin (it's Roman but what the heck), Swordsman, Cavalier, Centaur, Pegasus, Unicorn, Giant, Hell Hound, Harpy, Medusa, Minotaur, Cyclops, Basilisk, Gorgon and Hydra. There are no taverns so only way other creatures can be get on the map is due to month of the creature.
-I apologize any bad English, I think it's still easier to understand than Finnish.
