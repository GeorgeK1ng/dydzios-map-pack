Narrative:	Start underground and secure.  Build up and venture above to expand your empire and conqueor your enemies.
		Primarily a single player game though careful attention was made to balance the starts so could become a decent multiplayer map.
		One area in particular offers many rewards.  It is however well guarded. Teal is a computer only color and will have a huge army by the time you find him.
		This is my first SOD map but I have done a few HOMM II maps.  Email me if you like this one and I'll send you the others.

Put tips, strategies or other spoilers here if you have any.

Get above ground as soon as possible.  Take the two towns underground quickly and choose which to build up.  Might be best to build the original as gold producing initially,
and the second and your army producer as it is closer to underground stairs.  Hit the random creature generator in week 1 if you get lucky with a level 6 or 7 stack you might be able to leave the underground in week 1.
Make sure your above ground by week 3 or you will miss out on large amounts of resources and experience. Movement as always is essential.  Don't neglect pathfinding on your main hero as there are a few rough terrain areas
that seem to attract action.  I suggest diplomacy on your primary hero and travel with at least 1 other hero so that he may benefit from random stack joins. As soon as you get above ground and raise a significant army send 
your primary hero to the islands at the maps center.  The center holds some advantages like artifacts and Level 5 spell structures.  I play tested this 3 times and each time the computer beat me to the center and found the 
randomly placed grail almost immediately... so you'll need to get there fast.  If you get a tower town, build up the mage guild right away and town portal is likely. This map becomes alot easier with town portal. Its easy
to lose site of the conqueoring while building up the above towns.  If speedy victory is your thing focus on the underground towns and computer seems to fold more quickly.
