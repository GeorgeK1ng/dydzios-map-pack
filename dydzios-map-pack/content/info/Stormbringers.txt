Map Name:	Stormbringers  
Map Maker:	Gregory L. Reeves & Yung
E-Mail Address:	akame77@msn.com & raven@mars.ark.com

Map Type:	[Singleplayer] [1 Human Only, 6 Computer Only]
Language:	English

Description:	[]
		 

Special Win:	[none]
Special Loss:	lose Tombstone
Special Other:	[NONE]

Narrative:	Everyone is assembled for the Tournament of Honor, 
		for the right to use the Sacred Artifacts but... 
		One lone scholar altered the course of things to be
		and now the air is thick with expectation, deceit,
		schemes, and foul play. Come, come see what tangled
		webs we weave.

Instructions:	Please select gold as the starting bonus for EACH 
		of the AI factions - This is to avoid a 2.1 patch
		problem of the AI hero getting a random artifact.
		
		Also be aware that you may lose some of your starting
		heroes.  Samantha and one other must not be lost, 
		these are the minimum requirements.

		All items and some resources have been customized so
		hold on to that quick click till you've had a look :)

		This map is story based but you will not find it 
		linear in nature. Because of the free flowing nature
		of the map the hints that give you direction become
		more important so try and comply as soon as you can.



Epilogue:	Cannon fodder ties up the end of the saga of the 
		Stormbringers and introduces you to Helena.

Minor Spoilers:


Remember that you have the use of a tavern. (surrender is an option)

I recommend that your heroes take the experience offered from chests.

Resurrection is out there - build it an they will rise.

Spells that have been banned are the usual suspects - fly and DD. 
Town Portal, restricted but not banned.

Aggressive expansion will serve you better than a slow reserved pace.

Build up Carbonek before Tombstone with the exception of the resource 
silo.

Find the white and light green tents to get to the Northern Dwarves.
Send a secondary hero as soon as possible.

Find the white, light green and tan tents to access the grail location.

Ask either of us if you need more.
