		I dont intend to give it all away. But I will give you a few suggetions. 
		 First  week  you should build in the exact order: , Blacksmith, Barracks, Griffin Tower, Citidale, Castle. Claim the sawmill. 				Proceed past Medusa head west. Free the prisoner. Return to castle collect troops. Have a portal of glory built before week 2 				ends. Have a upper portal of glory built before the end of week 3.

		You take the rampart town first. After building all  the level 1 structures with the exception of the dragon cliffs, proceed by boat west where you
		will find a hill fort to upgrade your troops. Do the same once you take the elemental conflux there you will proceed due east by boat
		to find the hill fort.

		Resources will require careful management, so use them wisely and save upgrading your mage guilds for last.
		King Aruthur will have to satisfy the quest gates requirements in order to make any headway in the map. In fact if you wait to long it will
		spell certain disater, If the final A.I (pink) are able to combine their troops.

		The 2 stronghold towns & the two fortress towns have events just before them that give a $ 50,000 bonus as do the rampart and elemental 			conflux towns that you encounter early on in the map.
		
		You will find  small primary skill bonuses and troops behind the green and red gates that line the north & south areas.
		KIng Arthur will find relics as the game progresses. DO NOT LOSE THEM OR TRANSFER THEM. They will be required to complete the
		map. 

		Old Camelot which can be reached after completing the quests of Truth, Courage & Honor contain a large quantity of toops which have been
		building from day 1. You will need them to face the minions of Jealousy, Deciet & Anger which will start to appear around day 82. It is strongly
		recomended that you secure Old Camelot before that happens are you will not have the troops or mobility (town portal) to face them.
