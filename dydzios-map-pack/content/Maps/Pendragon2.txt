SPECIAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS:
		I would like to extend a special thanks to Yung. who gave me a lot of good
		advice on the nuts & bolts of this map before it was sent to the testers. 
		I have no less than 10 emails from him detailing what worked & what did'nt &
		why. A majority of which I incorperated into the map or used as a springboard to
		to another idea. I suspect all mapmakers get to a point where everything 
		begins to look abstract after they've played their own map 10 times. 
		It really helps to have a fresh perspective. So if you enjoy the map he
		well deserves part of the credit for helping to smooth out the rough parts. 
		Thanks again Yung.
		
		And as usual the map testers did a superb job of pointing out & catching
		the things that are so easy to overlook & reafirming if they think its fit 
		for posting or needs more work. I for one, really appreceiate anyone who 
		volunteers their time. I suspect they end up playing a lot of maps they 
		wouldnt normaly play, not because they are bad maps but because their tastes
		may run in another direction. Thanks again, keep up the good work.

  Strategy Guide....From day 1 build Camelot up as much as you can. You should not come under
attack before week 4. Leave one Hero at or near Camelot at all times. Your first mission 
should be to either capture the Stronghold castle where Percivil is inprisoned or the 
Fortress castle where Guinevere is inprisoned. Both will provide you with additional
Heros as well as a portal to & from Camelot.
  
  Dont begin to build the Tower towns until you are sure you have enough funds & resources to 
manage the castles in the surrounding area. I would not start any serious building until late 
month 2 or you may run short when you really need it. Beware the Rampart Heros, they may 
infiltrate just when you think you've got things under control. After you have secured the 
2 Fortress towns & the 2 Stronghold towns you are ready to proceed to the Rampart towns. 
  
  Split your Heros into 2 groups. Send the strongest with the weakest. Proceed down the East 
road & the West road. Advance with caution. After you have secured both Ramparts continue on
to the Towers collect the troops. Proceed to the Inferno Towns again advance with caution.
  
  You must have Heros at the east & west gates to unlock the passageway.  At the gate to 
the Tomb of souls combine your strongest troops under your strongest Hero. Defeat the 
Gate Guardian. 
  
  Proceed to the Elemental Conflux. Divide Heros & Troops up. From this point on its cat & 
mouse. You being the mouse most of the time. Pick & choose your battles wisely. Leave 1 
Hero at the Elemental Conflux to harvest troops. Proceed north thru the Catacombs until
you reach the Black Riders domain. 

  Find the entrance to the Hall of Mirrors. It will take 2 Heros to retrieve the Grail. 
Beware if the Black Rider is tracking you he may gain access to Camelot. It might be wise 
to use another Hero to lure him away. Hope you enjoy the map.
