Map Description:

I've spent quite a lot of time on this map. But it was very fun to do it, and I hope you and your friends finds it fun to play, as me and my friends did.
The map is pretty detailed with lots of things to do, and there is a risk your hero will die if you step in the wrong place...
Ok, what are you waiting for? Start playing now!!!

My next Project is a XL map with both overworld and underground.
It will also be a multiplayer map, but with a lot of RPG elements in it. However, it will take quite a while before I finish it ( I've barely started ) so enjoy Dream Land until then.
