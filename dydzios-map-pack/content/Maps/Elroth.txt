		believe "Elroth" is a much stronger map design than it was when I 
		began. Thanks guys! :-)

o Check the tavern regularly for clues to the Sage Hut quests.

o The computer players will usually avoid fighting the Water Elementals that block
passage along the river until the second or third month.

o Elrothia is heavily guarded, but if you're able to capture it as soon as possible 
(which may not be for several months) and then hold onto it, you'll stand a much 
better chance of winning. The computer players usually won't go for it too early on.

o Given the time limit, the special win condition is a lot easier to accomplish than 
the normal win.
