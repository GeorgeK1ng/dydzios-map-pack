Into the Black Heart

This "Shadow of Death" scenario is played on a medium map with up to three human or computer players.  The victory condition is defeat of a hero controlled by a fourth player.  Players are advised to heed the warning to avoid the underworld until a large army is mustered.

This scenario has been thoroughly tested by the author, but no one else as yet.
