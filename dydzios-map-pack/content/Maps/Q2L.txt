Type: 2P MP coop map 
Size: XL 2 layers
Game Version: SoD
Language: English. 

Description:
  Pick one of two legends of the world to dominate it once again.

Game specifics:
  - designed to be played by 2 players cooperatively, but can be played VS as well 
    by deselecting the 'enable teams' box in the teams tab under map specifications.
  - map is basically divided in 2 parts; starting with a long mirrored exploration 
    part, with some story texts. After that, the map opens up to a mutual battle 
    against the AI.
  - long play, long battles, little resources, relatively little towns.
  - high challenge. Map was designed to be played at expert level, but can be played
    at any other difficulty as well.
  - fly and dimension door are disabled.
  - little to no story.

Rules:
  - map was meant to be played with an additional rule: 
    --[ don't recruit armies from external dwellings ]--
    Flagging of external dwellings serves to boost the regular towns' growth. Whether 
    you stick to this rule or not is ofcourse completely up to you :-)

Comments: 
  - Primarily tested during play with (and 2 times against) my brother.
  - designed to be just a fun map for players who like long and challenging coop games.
  - map was created in 1999, but long thought lost to a virus. Only recently recovered.
