Map-Testers:   [Since this map is rather old, I had a lot of time to test it/tweak it myself.
  I played about 10 singleplayer games and 1 online game.  My brother also played the map a few times.]

Description:   [You are able to form an unbreakable defensive line (using several heroes) along
 "your" shore, which will protect you from sea invasions.  However, don't count on that indefinitely.]

Additional Info: [Since strategy is the focus of this map, there is no storyline at all.
  Instead, it's designed to maximize strategic possibilities.  Basically, there are 4 main
 islands and several smaller ones.  It's perfect for multiplayer games, and a surprisingly
 good single player challenge on highest diff.]

[Sea movement is important.

Those monsters on that adjacent island will join you.

Quests will give you powerful artifacts.

The only places to "land" on your island are near your secondary town.

Resource mines are dispersed on several small islands.

The only other way to get on a "blocked" island is by using the dimension door on the central island.]
