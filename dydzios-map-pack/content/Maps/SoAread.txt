	1. Don't waste time with Diplomacy if Mathias has the opportunity to learn it- 	all wandering stacks are set to "Savage."

	2. Don't use peasants as troops.  They die WAY too easily, and you might not 	be able to compensate for lost peasants.

	3. Don't enter the Tranavan Forest or the Cyclops Cavern until much later in 	the game, otherwise, troop loss might prevent players from completing the 	scenario.

	4. Do take ALL experience from chests, otherwise Mathias might not reach level 	10, thus preventing him from fulfilling the Seer's Quest.

	5. This scenario *IS* possible to complete!  =)
