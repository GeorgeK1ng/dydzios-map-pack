Language:	English

Description:	Four powerful houses seek to control Agraine's Vale, a 
		heavily populated valley filled with weak towns that are 
		virtually indefensible.  Only the house that builds the 
		grail can win the hearts and minds of the valley's 
		citizens and, thereby, control Agraine's Vale.
	

Special Win:	Build the grail structure.
Special Loss:	None.

Difficulty:	Expert.

Notes:		My last, most difficult, and probably my _best_ H3 map, 
		Agraine's vale tells a story and requires skill to win. 
		Note that in some versions of HOMM 3, one has to scroll 
		up (in the new scenario menu) in order to find this map. 
		"All for One" gets listed on top, by default, while 
		Agraine's Vale will show up above it only if the scroll 
		bar is used.
