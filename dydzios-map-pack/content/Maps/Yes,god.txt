Try both Satan and God as they bith differ. 
If you take Satan, remember look for wood and stone as fast you can. Remember Satan is a powerful hero and his spells are very important. You should rely on him and his spells more than his army.
If you choose God remember you should try to build the structures as soon as you can.
