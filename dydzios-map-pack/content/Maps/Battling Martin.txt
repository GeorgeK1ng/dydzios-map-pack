**Possible Spoilers here!!**

There is one "bug" I've noticed with the map.  Sometimes the group of Archangels guarding Martin do not grow as they should, which makes it easy to defeat him.  Other times they do grow, as intended.  I cannot explain this, and I hesitate to set the angels to a set number and not to grow.  I have set them to a fixed amount (6) and to grow, which I hope will solve the problem.

It is necessary to visit the islands to get access to the keymaster tents which will finally give you access to Martin himself.
