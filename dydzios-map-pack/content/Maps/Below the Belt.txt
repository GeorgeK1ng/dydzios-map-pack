Notes:		Congratulations! You have just downloaded a map that is unique in a way. Never before have I seen a HoMM map with this victory condition. (I wonder why?) This means you won't have a castle (or even a citadel for most of the game). Don't worry, you'll have a nice creature growth through a town event + artifacts, and the AI doesn't get full towns either.
Another peculiarity is the seer's quests. In most cases there are two seers living close to each other who are seeking for the same artifact. So don't give the goodies to the first one you come across. The second seer may have a reward you like better.
