Map Type:	Singleplayer, 1H5C

Language:	English

Description:	You, the amazingly responsible nephew, have broken your uncle's statuette. Hmm... and wouldn't be so coincidental that he would like the statuette brought to his castle right now?

Special Win:	Transport Artifact
Special Loss:	Lose Alagar and (special) time limit.

Miscellaneous:
Play on (at least) expert. A stupid AI is a stupid game.
I apologise for a non-existent underground. I started out with one but scratched it out finally. Since I can't get rid of it, it's sort of stuck there. There is NO underground. Just remember that. No secret passages to a secret underground cavern.
Well, nothing else really (that I can recall), so... have a good time and all those other cliched tidings.

Horde if you want, it'll make all the enemies all the more powerful, and all the more fun, but it'll take time to do that, and waiting around for troops may not be your idea of fun.

Time. there is no actual time limit, but after day 74, things will get a mite impossible to kill. okay, fine, after day 74 you can't win.

Secret passages. Since when has any of my maps come equiped without? =) Be prepared for more frustrating mouse clicking all over the place. (Hahaha! =Þ)

The treasure chests signify secrets, most probably secret passages. Use them as hints to a hidden something. To a piece of legion more often than not.

There's a Grail on the map. See if you can find it.
