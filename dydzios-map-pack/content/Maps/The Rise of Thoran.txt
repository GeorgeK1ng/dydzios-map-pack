Description: The world of Vallaria was a peaceful and prosperous one. Divided into different kingdoms, that after long struggles finally succeded in settling their differences and live peacefully. Only a couple of decades had passed since peace was achieved when a new threat arrived: Thoran, the Wizard King.-

Additional Info: You can play as the Necromancers of Noblezombie or the Knights of Clearwater. You must free the world of Vallaria from the evil of Thoran, the Wizard King. This map took me a really long time to finish, I wanted to make it perfect; Beautiful, fun and with a deep story. I finally think that it's over and well balanced. I hope with all my heart that everyone enjoys it, and that whoever plays it, will have the courtesy of sending me an e-mail telling me what they think, if the map is good or if they think that something should be changed; thanks a lot.-
