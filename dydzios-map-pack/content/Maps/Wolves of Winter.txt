Wolves of Winter is a story from the archives of Black Finn.
  During the wars against the old Empire, Finn was employed by a number of rebel forces. 
In the deep midwinter of northern Valcoria,  he found 
himself fighting for the rebels against a larger imperial force. 
Fortunately, the rebels had managed to damage the infrastructure of both the Imperial Citadels.

During this period in the history of the northern states and islands, the Empire was making a last effort
 to put down the rebellions and make an example of leading rebels. Valcoria was to see a number of short wars, lying
as it did upon the border of land controlled by Imperial forces and the leading rebel states. 
 
The scenario pitches you as Finn against the two Imperial forces. Good luck !
