No history is 100% true. The history of the beginning of the universe is 100% lies. Let me tell you how it really happened. First let me tell you a few facts about God and Satan. 

There is no ONE god! There is Daddy God and Mommy God. We also have Grandpa and Grandma God. Plus Cousin God, Little God, God II, God Junior, Big Fat God, Big Boss God...umm...I think you god..er...GOT...my point. There is another race beside humans called - guess?- 'God'. Shocked? Surprised? 
The God race is a huge race. So what do these God's do? They live a life just like ours. But their main purpose in life is to create other worlds. But not every God can be a World-Creator. They need to have a licence. I know what you are going to ask next! How do they get a licence? Right? Oh...you wanted to ask 'Why am I talking to you?'...er...never mind that. Back to the licence part. At first they need to be over 21000000000 light years old. And they need an education in World-Creation. 
After they did that they do a few mini-tests. Make a few universes...a few planets...some races. Stuff like that. However under strict supervision. 
If they pass that they get a level 3 licence. They have some restrictions on making worlds. Few more tests...few more millions of light years of study...and they go to Level 2. Now they are free to do what they want. Level 2 has no restriction. But there is a regular check by the Head-Gods on the world. Level 1 has no restrictions and no check-ups.
Now, listen, to World-Create one needs a partner to help him. The partner is always another World-Creator with the same level as him. To get to World-Create alone one needs to have the Level 1 * access, which of course is very hard. After several million years the Supervisers checks up on the world and see who the race of the world worships. The idea behind this is that the one who is worshiped more is probably a better God. The chosen God gets a Level 1 * access.

Enough of that. Lets talk about our 'God'. Son of a rich BusinessGod, our 'God' is a rich spoilt brat. His father owns the famous 'Bibalet - Create your world our way, the easy way!' So rich kid grows up. Studies for World-Creation. Fails. Tries again. Fails. Father gets him the best money-can-buy tution. The little bastard fails. Father has high dreams for son. Father..er..influences the right people...er...with...money. Son passes! Son soon becomes Level 1.
By the way, his name is Alawar Lah. Though they call him 'Al' for short. Al. Lah. Al-Lah. Allah. I guess the Arab Muslims got that right. Back to our story. Al has it all - money, fame, godesses. Except brains..but who needs that when you can have the others? And he needed something all World-Creators should have. They must be good, kind, generous, etc. Al didn't have any of these. He had a rotten personality and liked to do wierd things in his World-Creations. But he has a rich father. I guess money also talks in God World.
Read the God.txt for the fact-file on Al. 
If you remember, I said that all Levels needed a partner. Who was Al's partner?

Enter Lucifer Satanic. Luke for short. Luke is a good kid. Helps his parents with their small shop.Visits his granparents once in a while. Helps others whenever he can. You know the kind. Unfortunatly he is very poor.  Studies when he is not working. Has a tough life. Mr. and Mrs. Satanic are good parents. They give lots of encouragment and support to Luke. His struggle finally rewards him when he gets the Level 1 in World-Creation.

As fate has it the two Gods work together on World-Creation as partners. They hate each other's guts...or...whatever entity God's have. Al's reason for his hatred is jealousy. He hates it when Luke gets better results than him. He hates lower class peasants getting more attention than himself! Luke's reason of course is simple. We all hate people who try everyway - illegal if it may - to get our career's destroyed. 

So what happens? Al tries to make a world where his creation do as he bids. Al wants to play God...er..I mean...um...wants to be a leader or something...er...I think you know what I mean. Poor Luke tries his best to convince Al to make a world filled with happiness and goodness. 
Luke wants all creatures to be equal. But Al creates many kinds and make them fight each other. Luke creates emotions such as love, kindess, etc. Al creates hatred, greed, the urge to smash someone's head against the wall, etc. Luke has many sleepless nights trying to figure ways for the humans to live in a better conditions. To reduce their pains and sufferings. 
Al plays with his creation. He makes them do weird things. He MAKES wierd things. E.g. Dennis Rodman.
With this you expect the humans to worship Luke but Al wants the Level 1 * access so enters caring father. Father takes over Luke's parents' shop. You know what!? No money for poor ol' Luke. He takes odd jobes to try to support himself and his family. More work = Less time for World Creation. 
With the best equipments and lots of time, Al introduces many ideas in the human world. He uses Propaganda to influence the human minds.  He pays a writer to write him a book for the humans. Guess which book? The Holy Book. Though it has been changed a bit with time - the bible, the Qura'n, etc. The book is given to the people and in the first hundred years of the humans Al uses many tactics and Miracles (provided by Miracle Magic - The best Miracles for the best Gods). 
In this space of time Luke was usually away doing the odd jobs. With his father sick he hardly had any spare time to World-Create. Luke's father dies. Mother gets heart-brocken. Poor goddess dies too. Luke is alone. But this means that Luke only needs to support himself. He gets on with his life. He has more time to World-Create but unfortunatly he is a bit late. Al has already filled the human heads with lies. The humans love 'God' (Al) - well most of them do - and hate 'Satan' (Luke). Did I tell you that the communication between God and his creatures is very hard. The first years are easier. It gets harder with time. Two things is very important to be able to communicate. Brains and money to buy the equipment. Luke had the first but not the second. Al had the second and, well, got help from others about the first. Anyway by the time Luke got to be able to World-Create it was already to late for communication.   

Years pass. There is nothing Luke can do. The human year 2012 is the Judgement day. Judgement does not mean what we think it means. By judgment they meant the day, the Head-Gods judge the two Gods. So Head-Gods come. They look at the human race. They ask a few questions. And Voila! Al is the winner. The Head-Gods think that Luke was the creator of all the pain and hatred in the human world. 
Poor ol' Luke. 
But Luke doesn't give up that easily. He goes to court and explains his position. Court investigates Al's father's takeover the shop of Luke's parents. They find it was illegal! Al's father comes to court. Pays the fine. Gives some to Luke. Goes back to his business.
Luke goes to the Office Of Head-Gods. They also look in the matter and decide that Al shouldn't be the winner. But they also cannot have Luke as the winner either. In situations like this they use the 'HOMM3 Plan' (no one knows what HOMM stands for)  Here is what they do:- They make a small planet with a few species and places the two Gods in two different parts of the planet. The aim of this is - 'survival of the fittest' 
Who ever destroys the other is the winner (of course, this is like our virtual reality - the Gods do not die in real life) and the winner is given the Level 1 *
