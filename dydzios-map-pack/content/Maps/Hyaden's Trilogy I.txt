notes :



Hyaden's Trilogy :
I   : Under the Guardian Wings
II  : The Dead Claw
III : Colours of the Rain





- This is the first chapter of Hyaden's Trilogy, the campaign map of three maps.
- Although Hyaden is using Kyrre's portrait which is default was female character, he is a male character.
- No Special Loss Condition here but losing any main characters of the map is not recommended.


- in Ufron's battle at least he must killed 2 cavaliers then Hyaden will be able to win the combat. (or if you have a better way tell me !)
- use statue of legion to horde your behemoth to fight those Dark Angels.
