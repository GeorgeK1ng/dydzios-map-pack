Description:    "As you struggle to hold together a weak alliance against your stronger enemies, the exiled Wizard of the north is growing strong.  Perhaps both sides have a common enemy..."

The theme of this map comes from the anti-altruism theme present in Ayn Rand's famous novel Atlas Shrugged.  "Utopia of Greed" is actually a name of a chapter from the book.  The player is the strong link in a crumbling alliance whose weaker allies are really only a burden.  Do you try to hang on and let them build themselves up or do you allow the alliance to fall apart and keep it all for yourself?  You decide.
