Designer Notes:

In order to provide the town atmosphere, many structures are duplicated.  Groups of 
witch huts intentionally provide the same secondary skill, and should be considered 
as "window dressing."  The same goes for many other of the commonly duplicated 
structures.  Fortunately for gameplay sake, the AI does not usually visit each 
one.

If you play this map as a single player, play at least on expert or impossible level.  This 
allows the AI to have more heroes and play more aggressively.

Err...none really here.  The cover of darkness and the churches in the middle of the 
map will get *really* irritating for your opponents after a while.  But it does 
provide a point of conflict.
Be sure to defend your town.  The roads combined with the stables allow invading 
armies to travel a suprising distance in one turn.

There is a "Cursed Town". (The Central Library)  It will take away slightly more
than you receive from it every turn.  This can get annoying after a while for 
single players, but it does provide an amusing point of conflict during 
multi-play.
