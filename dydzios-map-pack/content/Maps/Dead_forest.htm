color="#0000FF">Jörgen Linde</font></a>
E-Mail Address:	tomli@ebox.tninet.se</pre>

<pre>Map Type:	Medium, 2 Levels; 1H, (1C)

Difficulty:	Depends on certain approaches and the experience of the player.
		I'd say it varies from Normal - Expert, although it is now displayed as Expert.

Language:	English

<pre>Notes:		<font color="#000000">This is the first map of four in &quot;The Adventures of Wren&quot;.
</font>		The walkthrough is helpful if you wish to decrease the map difficulty.
		For additional map comments, see <a href="#Comments on the map">Comments on the map</a>.

Acknowledgement:
		This map was inspired by and loosely (some Characters and
		Locations &amp; Map) based on an adventure (&quot;Döda Skogen&quot;),
		written by Roger Undhagen for a paper and pencil RPG, 1985.

Update info:	Second submitted version. Updates include:
		Some changes to the map (minor) and reference files (mainly concerning texts)
		and a few additional 'monster texts' and Entry adjustments.</pre>

<pre>Description:	A somewhat different map where you only use small sized forces
		in an RPG kind of style. A reference file containing the stories
		(&quot;Deadfor.htm&quot;) is included.
		Play time varies, but is estimated to approx. 2 hours.

Instructions:	Only choose a player difficulty of <em>Impossible</em> and a starting bonus
		of either <em>Gold</em> or <em>Resources</em> (- <u>Not</u> <em>Artifact</em>) for both you <u>and</u> the
		computer.
		Preferably, you should print the Reference (= &quot;Deadfor.htm&quot;) out on
		paper.
		Read 'Pretext' and 'Chapter 1' in the Reference file, <u>before</u>
		starting the map.
		Read 'Grim &amp; Grum' and 'The Dark Knight' before resolving combat
		with the appropriate red heroes.</pre>

<pre>Special Win:	Defeat monster (= Open the Gate)
Special Loss:	Lose the hero named Wren
Special Other:	none</pre>

<pre>Narrative:	You are Wren, a young elvish woman, on a quest, trying to reunite
		the Old Peoples before it is too late...</pre>

<font color="#8000FF">Should any of your Characters die on the map but still be in the story,
then consider them wounded and out of action, but not dead.
All characters, save the Dwarves, will be following you to the sequel.
(- If you tamed the Unicorn, it won't follow to the sequel - it will return to
its forest home).
</font>
<font color="#8000FF">

</font><font color="#400080"><em>Weakness of the map</em>:</font><font
color="#8000FF">
Since you are using small sized forces, you are vulnerable to 'week of x doubles!'
If this occurs, you'll have to re-load the auto save until a normal week occurs.
If the loading doesn't help, then you may have to start the map over again.

</font><font color="#400080"><em>Which Artifacts symbolize the Keys and the Poem?
</em></font><font color="#8000FF">The White Pearl (a helpful Key, as long as you have it): Ring of Wayfarer.
The Black Pearl (of no special use while having it): Diplomat's Ring
The Horn of Shell (of little use while having it): Ring of Conjuring
The Poem (Prerequisite - Horn of Shell): Ring of life
When opening the Gate, you will lose these artifacts but gain allies in order to win.

</font><font color="#400080"><em>Additional Rules</em>:</font><font
color="#8000FF">
Always keep the Shackles of War equipped! - Yes, this means you only have 3 slots left.
Do not sacrifice any of the Artifacts which are symbolizing the Keys.
Do not sacrifice the Shackles of War.
Do not sell any of the above Artifacts.
Do not use any cheat codes.
